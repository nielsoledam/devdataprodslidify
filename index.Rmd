## Introduction

The Shiny App was made using the brilliant mapDK package made by Sebastian Barfort.

It is basically just demonstrating a subset of what this nice package is able to acomplish.

On the next two pages will be shown a sample map, generated directly by R in Slidify and the code that generated the map.

--- .class #id 

## Sample Map

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(mapDK)
name <- "socialdemokratiet"
mapDK(values = "stemmer", id = "id",
      data = subset(votes, navn == name),
      detail = "polling", show_missing = FALSE,
      guide.label = paste("Votes \n", name, " (pct)", sep=""))
```
